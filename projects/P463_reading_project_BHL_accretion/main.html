            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <br/>
            Accretion of gaseous matter onto a moving body is a phenomenon of huge importance in stellar astronomy. It is a key feature in both formation and evolution of celestial bodies. The rate, at which a point mass moving through a uniform gas cloud accretes mass, was first studied and calculated by F. Hoyle and R. A. Lyttleton (1939, 1940). The problem is later investigated by H. Bondi and F. Hoyle (1944) and H. Bondi (1951) and the accretion model has been named after all three of them. As our knowledge in the field of stellar evolution expanded with time, Bondi-Hoyle-Lyttleton (BHL) accretion model has been adapted and incorporated for a vast number of complex systems.


            <br/><br/>

            In the original works of Bondi, Hoyle and Lyttleton, a star, taken as a point mass, moves through a gas cloud, uniform and free of self-gravity, and attracts a bulk of mass to concentrate behind it. Some of the gas then can be accreted to the point mass. However, this calculation doesn't account for the gravitational force exerted by the bulk on the point mass in a direction opposite to its motion. This force, namely "drag force", was first considered by Chandrasekhar (1943) and studied in many other literatures in later times.

            Let's look at the problem from the rest frame of the point mass (in this case, star; S). A uniform cloud of intergalactic gas is streaming past S from right to left in the diagram. The initial velocity and density of the gas (unaffected by the star's gravitational field) are \(v_\infty\) and \(\rho_\infty\), respectively. The impact parameter, denoted by \(\sigma\) is called the Bondi radius, i.e. the radius of the column of the gas which is eventually accreted by the star. We try to derive an expression for the impact parameter from the equation of motion of the gas particle from A (or B) to C.

            <br/>

            We recognise that the equation of motion is an equation of conic section,

            $$ \frac{l}{r} = 1 + e cos\theta $$

            At initial asymptote (\(l << r\)), the equation of direction parallel to asymptote is given by,

            $$ 1 + e cos\theta = 0 $$

            The opposite direction (direction parallel to SC) corresponds to,

            $$ e cos\theta = 1 $$

            Substituting \(e cos\theta\) in (1) gives us an expression for SC,

            $$ \frac{l}{SC} = 1 + 1 $$
            $$ \Rightarrow SC = \frac{l}{2} $$

            Now, we differentiate (1) with respect to time,

            $$ - \frac{l}{r^2} \frac{dr}{dt} = - e sin \theta \frac{d\theta}{dt} $$
            $$ \Rightarrow \frac{dr}{dt} = \frac{esin\theta}{l} r^2 \frac{d\theta}{dt} = \frac{ehsin\theta}{l} [h = r^2 \frac{d\theta}{dt} = constant] $$

            Now,

            $$ h = \sqrt{GMl} = v_\infty \sigma $$

            $$ \Rightarrow l = \frac{v^2_\infty \sigma ^2}{GM} $$

            \(\therefore \) At C, the velocity of gas = \(v_\infty\)

            The gas particle will fail to escape if,

            $$ v^2_\infty < \frac{2GM}{SC} = \frac{4GM}{l} = \frac{4G^2M^2}{v^2_\infty \sigma^2} $$
            $$ \therefore \sigma < \frac{2GM}{v^2_\infty} $$

            We finally get the mass accretion rate,

            $$ \dot{M}_{HL} = \pi \sigma^2 v_\infty \rho_\infty = \frac{4 \pi G^2 M^2 \rho_\infty}{v^3_\infty} $$


            <br/><br/>


            <h2>For More Complex Systems</h2>
            <br/><br/>

            In the original formalism by Hoyle and Lyttleton (1939), the gas density reaches infinity along the accretion axis (CS in Figure 1). Bondi and Hoyle (1944) investigated the problem for a more realistic situation with a finite gas density column along the accretion axis. They calculate the modified accretion rate with an additional parameter \(\alpha\),

            $$ \dot{M}_{BH} = \frac{4 \pi \alpha G^2 M^2 \rho_\infty}{v^3_\infty} $$

            They found out that the value of \(\alpha\) lies between \(\frac{1}{2}\) and 1; however, the exact value of \(\alpha\) is indeterminate and depends on the initial conditions as well as perturbations applied on the system. For a star moving perpendicularly into a cloud, they found the value of \(\alpha\) to be 0.625 [Bondi and Hoyle (1944)].

            <br/><br/>

            A notable point is that the cloud has been taken non-interacting for calculation shown until now. In most cases, the accretion radius of the star is much greater than the mean free path between particles. In such cases, the gas flow has to be treated as a fluid. However, in most cases, the flow of such a fluid is supersonic and the thermal energy density is negligible in comparison to the kinetic energy density. In that case, the pressure terms of the fluid equation can be neglected except along the accretion axis and the equation can be reduced to the equation with particle orbit.

            <br/><br/>

            However, for subsonic and mildly supersonic cases, the fluid equations cannot be reduced so easily. Bondi (1952) studied this case for a simpler model with the star fixed in the gas frame and the accretion becoming spherically symmetric. The radius corresponding to the accretion radius, Bondi Radius, is given by,

            $$ R_B = \frac{GM}{c^2_\infty} $$

            where \(c^2_\infty\) is the speed of sound at a large distance. \(c^2_\infty\) can be given by the following expression with ratio of specific heat (\(\gamma\)), universal gas constant (\(R\)), temperature of gas at large distance (\(T_\infty\)) and mean molecular weight (\(\mu\)),

            $$ c^2_\infty = \gamma R T_\infty / \mu $$

            The accretion rate for such a case is given by,

            $$ \dot{M}_{B} = \frac{4 \pi \lambda G^2 M^2 \rho_\infty}{c^3_\infty} $$

            The non-dimensional parameter \(\lambda \) has a critical limit \(\lambda_c \) and is dependent on \(\gamma \). For isothermal and adiabatic cases, \(\gamma\) has the values 1 and \(5/3\) and \(\lambda_c\) has the values 1.12 and 0.25. The exact value of \(\lambda \) could be found by matching the flow pressure at the surface of the star to the surface pressure of the star.

            <br/><br/>

            The similarity between the expressions for \(\dot{M}_{B} \) and \(\dot{M}_{BH} \) has been noticed by Bondi (1952) and an equation for accretion rate for intermediate cases has been suggested,

            $$ \dot{M} = \frac{2 \pi G^2 M^2 \rho_\infty}{(c^2_\infty + v^2_\infty)^\frac{3}{2}} $$

            The simplicity of this equation allows it to be used frequently and reasonably for intermediate cases, even though it lacks the "mathematical foundation", as quoted by Hunt (1971).


            <br/><br/>


            <h2>Drag Force</h2>
            <br/><br/>

            The idea of "dynamical friction" experienced by a star was first given by Chandrasekhar (1943). In the Bondi-Hoyle-Lyttleton scheme of accretion, the gas starts to accumulate behind the star. As a result, the star moving through the gas starts to experience a force against its motion. It is worth mentioning that the drag force is not an outcome of frictional resistance from gas particles in the direction of its motion. In its mathematical formulation, the accretor is taken as a point particle; moreover, the radius of the accretor in a real scenario is less than the total accretion radius. Rather, the difference in density, and consequently the gravitational pull, behind and ahead of the accretion would be a much more significant factor. This gravitational force from behind the accretor is known as "drag force" and Chandrasekhar named the phenomena "dynamical friction".

            <br/><br/>

            While the driving force behind the drag is easier to understand, it might be extremely complicated to derive an expression for a real system. However, simple dimensional analysis can give us an estimate [Edgar (2004)],


            $$\dot{M} v_{\infty} \sim M \dot{v}_{\infty}=F_{\mathrm{drag}} $$

            It has been suggested later [Ruffert and Arnett (1994)] that the drag force is actually within a factor of 10 greater than this estimate. In any case, this approximation suggests a constant motion of the star with respect to the gas flow, while the mass keeps increasing. We can easily conclude that such a system is not self-sustainable as the momentum changes with time. 

            <br/><br/>

            A detailed discussion on the expression for drag force can be found in Dokuchev (1964), Binnery and Tremaine (1987). The expression for drag force for supersonic motion in a gaseous medium was studied and proposed by Ruderman and Spiegel (1971) and Rephaeli & Salpeter (1980),

            $$ F_{ss} = \dot{M} v_{\infty} ln(\frac{b_{max}}{b_{min}}) $$

            where the subscript \(ss\) denotes a solution in steady supersonic case, \(b_{max}\) and \(b_{min}\) are respectively the effective radii of the surrounding medium and the star. The magnitude of the drag force different systems was further studied by Shima et al. (1985), Ruffert and Arnett (1994), Ostriker (1998) etc. However, the precise value of the drag force depends critically on the system and is still a matter of debate in the community.

            <br/><br/>

            An important consequence of the dynamical friction is rejuvenation of a star [McCrea (1953), Hunt(1971)]. Hunt (1971) calculated the effect of drag force on the velocity of a star moving through a fairly dense cloud (\(10^3 particles/ cm^3\)) for a standard \(\alpha \) value 0.625 and he found that the drag is able to reduce the velocity from \(20 km/s\) to \(1 km/s\). As a result, the star is able to accrete more material and it can have a relatively higher mass fraction of hydrogen (assuming that the cloud is composed mostly of hydrogen) after a reasonable time (in order of million years).


            <br/><br/>

            <h2>Direct Observation</h2>

            <br/><br/>

            The rate of accretion for a galaxy, given by the expression for \(\dot{M}_{BH}\), has also been calculated by Hunt(1971) for \(\alpha = 0.625 \) and \(\rho_{\infty} = 10^3 particles cm^{-3}\). The rate was found to be \(10^7 M_\odot/ My\) and it takes the galaxy \(2\times 10^10 \) years to double up the mass. It is needless to mention that we cannot have any direct observational evidence for such a low value of mass difference. Although the accretion through BHL mechanism for specific systems has been studied and rate has been compared to results from simulations.

            <b>Summary</b><br>
            <p class="abstract">
                In this article we have discussed the presence of matter and voids in the Universe when looked at large scales. Some cutting edge ongoing research and simulations to better undertand there presence is presented. We have taken a look at gravitational instability, or more polpularly known as Jeans instabilty, which is the theoretical basis from which the formation of these large scale structures initiate. Then we briefly take a look at redshift surveys that maps the structures, their position in the space, and highlights why these surveys are important for our understanding of the large scale structures.
