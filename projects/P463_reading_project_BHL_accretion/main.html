            <h2>A brief Introduction</h2>
            <br/>
            Accretion of gaseous matter onto a moving body is a phenomenon of huge importance in stellar astronomy. It is a key feature in both formation and evolution of celestial bodies. The rate, at which a point mass moving through a uniform gas cloud accretes mass, was first studied and calculated by F. Hoyle and R. A. Lyttleton (1939, 1940). The problem is later investigated by H. Bondi and F. Hoyle (1944) and H. Bondi (1951) and the accretion model has been named after all three of them. As our knowledge in the field of stellar evolution expanded with time, Bondi-Hoyle-Lyttletone (BHL) accretion model has been adapted and incorporated for a vast number of complex systems.


            <br/><br/>

            In the original works of Bondi, Hoyle and Lyttleton, a star, taken as a point mass, moves through a gas cloud, uniform and free of self-gravity, and attracts a bulk of mass to concentrate behind it. Some of the gas then can be accreted to the point mass. However, this calculation doesn't account for the gravitational force exerted by the bulk on the point mass in a direction opposite to its motion. This force, namely "drag force", was first considered by Chandrasekhar (1943) and studied in many other literatures in later times.

            Let's look at the problem from rest frame of the point mass (in this case, star; S). A uniform cloud of intergalactic gas is streaming past S from right to left in the diagram. The initial velocity and density of the gas (unaffected by star's gravitational field) are \(v_\infty\) and \(\rho_\infty\), respectively. The impact parameter, denoted by \(\sigma\) is called the Bondi radius, i.e. the radius of the column of the gas which is eventually accreted by the star. We try to derive an expression for the impact parameter from equation of motion of the gas particle from A (or B) to C.

            <br/>

            We recognise that the equation of motion is an equation of conic section,

            $$ \frac{l}{r} = 1 + e cos\theta $$

            At initial asymptote (\(l << r\)), the equation of direction parallel to asymtote is given by,

            $$ 1 + e cos\theta = 0 $$

            The opposite direction (direction parallel to SC) corresponds to,

            $$ e cos\theta = 1 $$

            Substituting \e cos\theta\ in (1) gives us an expression for SC,

            $$ \frac{l}{SC} = 1 + 1 \\
            \Rightarrow SC = \frac{l}{2} $$

            Now, we differentiate (1) with respec to time,

            $$ - \frac{l}{r^2} \frac{dr}{dt} = - e sin \theta \frac{d\theta}{dt} \\
            \Rightarrow \frac{dr}{dt} = \frac{esin\theta}{l} \dot r^2 \frac{d\theta}{dt} \\
            \Rightarrow \frac{dr}{dt} = \frac{ehsin\theta}{l} [h = r^2 \frac{d\theta}{dt} = constant] $$

            Now,

            $$ h = \sqrt{GMl} = v_\infty \sigma $$

            $$ \Rightarrow l = \frac{v^2_\infty \sigma ^2}{GM} $$

            \(\therefore \) At C, the velocity of gas = \(v_\infty\)

            The gas particle will fail to escape if,

            $$ v^2_\infty < \frac{2GM}{SC} = \frac{4GM}{l} = \frac{4G^2M^2}{v^2_\infty \sigma^2} $$
            $$ \therefore \sigma < \frac{2GM}{v^2_\infty} $$

            We finally get the mass accretion rate,

            $$ \dot{M}_{HL} = \pi \sigma^2 v_\infty \rho_\infty = \frac{4 \pi G^2 M^2 \rho_\infty}{v^3_\infty} $$

            <h2>Gravitational Instability</h2>
            <br/>
            The formation of structures in the Universe is a very complex phenomena which is not yet entirely understood. The initiation is a fluid dynamical process caused by a gravitational instability. This leads to the initially uniform interstellar medium into break into clumps.<br/><br/>

            Imagine initially there is a unifromly distributed gas and due to some disturbance at a certain region there is a compression. Acoustic waves would be created by the excess pressure in this compressed area. It will spread the compression in other areas as the gas return to its original uniform state. But at the compressed region there is also an enhanced gravitational attraction and thus will try to pull more gas into the compressed region. Here at this moment whether the acoustic waves win over the enhanced gravity or gravity wins will decide the fate on how the system is going to evolve. It can be demonstrated that greater gravity is not as significant and that acoustic waves take over if the region of compression is tiny. The greater gravity in the zone of compression, on the other hand, may outweigh the acoustic waves if the region of compression is larger than a critical size, drawing more material into the area and leading to an instability. James Jeans is the first person to demonstrate the existence of this instability. In his honour this phenomenais popularly known as <i>Jeans Instability</i>.<br/><br/>

            <h3>Jeans Mass</h3>
            <br/>
            The Jeans mass is the critical mass where the gravitational force and the internal pressure of molecular clouds are in equilibrium with each other. Jeans mass is often denoted by \(M_J\) and it's expression is given as

            $$ M_J = {4\over3}\pi\lambda_J^3\rho_o  $$

            where \(\rho_o\) is gas density and \(\lambda_J\) is Jeans length. Jeans length is expressed as

            $$ \lambda_J = {C_s\over(G\rho_o)^{1/2}} $$

            where \(C_s\) is gaseous isothermal sound speed and \(G\) is the Gravitational constant.

            If the mass of the molecular clouds is larger than the Jeans mass than it results in a collapse on itself i.e. the gravitational forces will overcome the internal pressure/thermal expansion energy. If it is equal to the Jeans mass than the resulting equilibrium holds the structure to stay in a stable state.<br/><br/>

            <h2>Redshift Surveys</h2>
            <br/>
            Our understanding of the spatial distribution of galaxies has greatly expanded over the past few decades from a very rough outline to what is now a rather precise picture of the local universe. The rate at which galaxies redshifts have been measured has very much increased over many surveys, which is the main cause of this change. These surveys are primarily driven by the idea that galaxies serve as the cosmological equivalent of signposts, indicating where massive concentrations of matter are located. A galaxy's redshift serves as its address that enables astronomers to locate it in space, along with its position on the sky. This is a result of Hubble's Law and the general expansion of the universe. We can generate a 3D map of the universe around us by measuring several redshifts. Cosmologists examine the information of the distribution of the galaxies to try to understand how the universe has developed to its present condition.<br/><br/>

            <h3>Observational Methods</h3>
            <br/>

            The observations in these redshift surveys are typically done in one of two modes, beam switching and frequency switching. In beam switching  the telescope observes on-source for a specified length of time, and then is moved off the source and integrates for a comparable amount of time on "blank sky". In most cases the off-source position is chosen so that the telescope tracks over precisely the same path as it followed while on the source (i.e., the same altitude and azimuth). In frequency switching the central frequency of the observed band is alternated between two values during the course of the observation so that the expected signal moves from one side of the observed frequency range to the other. Frequency switching can be more efficient than beam switching because of the prudent choice of frequency settings which allows one to observe the source 100% of the time. Beam switching, on the other hand, is employed almost primarily in redshift survey work since frequency switching only performs well over very small bandwidths and the correct frequency settings aren't known beforehand i.e., one doesn't know the redshift. <br/><br/>

            The Las Campanas Redshift Survey 1991 using the Las Campanas telescope in Chile. It has been considered to be the first attempt to map a large area of the Universe, redshift of z \(\sim 0.2\). It provided evidence for the Cosmological Principle of isotropy. Superclusters and voids are prominent features recorded by the survey.

            <h3>The 2dF Galaxy Redshift Survey</h3>
            <br/>
            The Two-degree-Field Galaxy Redshift Survey is a redshift survey conducted by the Australian Astronomical Observatory with the 3.9m Anglo-Australian Telescope between 1997 and 11 April 2002. The image shown below shows the data from this survey. As also seen in the image the image, the survey determined the large scale structure in two slices of the Universe toa depth of around 2.5 billion light years and \(\sim 0.2\) redshift.

            The main achievements from the 2dF survey include The measurement of the density parameter of non-relativistic matter, The detection of Baryon acoustic oscillations, and as a consequence the relationship between the density of baryonic matter and dark matter, limits on the contribution of massive neutrinos to dark matter and thus as a result putting a limit on the sum of the masses of the three families of neutrinos at 1.8 eV. All of these results agrees with other measurements from other project/missions, particularly with WMAP which provides confidence for the current standard cosmological model.

                In this article we have discussed the presence of matter and voids in the Universe when looked at large scales. Some cutting edge ongoing research and simulations to better undertand there presence is presented. We have taken a look at gravitational instability, or more polpularly known as Jeans instabilty, which is the theoretical basis from which the formation of these large scale structures initiate. Then we briefly take a look at redshift surveys that maps the structures, their position in the space, and highlights why these surveys are important for our understanding of the large scale structures.
